LISSA is a Python-based project designed to emulate how a voice assistant, like Google Assistant, functions. Built entirely using Python, LISSA leverages various libraries to handle voice interactions. It uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture and convert spoken words into text, allowing the assistant to understand user commands. Once the speech is recognized, LISSA processes the text and performs tasks based on the user's intent. To respond, it employs the `pyttsx3` library, which converts text back into speech, enabling the assistant to communicate with the user through voice output. Python’s extensive capabilities allow LISSA to be further expanded for task automation, integration with APIs, and even natural language processing. By using Python libraries and modules, LISSA effectively demonstrates how voice assistants work, handling speech-to-text, processing commands, and generating voice responses—all within a Python environment.
